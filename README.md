Code Explanation in Paragraphs (Point-Wise)
1. Objective:
    •	The program serves as a basic calculator allowing users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations: 
        o	Addition
        o	Subtraction
        o	Multiplication
        o	Division
    •	Designed with simplicity and error handling to enhance user experience.
2. Key Activities:
a. Define Arithmetic Functions:
    •	Separate functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide). 
        o	Addition: Takes two inputs and returns their sum.
        o	Subtraction: Computes the difference between two numbers.
        o	Multiplication: Returns the product of two numbers.
        o	Division: Checks for division by zero to prevent runtime errors. If valid, it computes the quotient.
b. Interactive User Input:
    •	Prompts the user to: 
        1.	Enter two numerical values.
        2.	Choose an operation by selecting from a numbered menu.
c. Execute Chosen Operation:
    •	Based on the user's choice: 
        o	Calls the corresponding function.
        o	Displays the result to the user in a readable format.
    •	Handles invalid inputs by displaying an appropriate error message.
3. Technologies Used:
    •	Python Programming: Utilizes core Python features such as: 
        o	Functions: Encapsulates operations for modular and reusable code.
        o	Conditional Statements (if-elif): Implements logic for operation selection.
    •	Input/Output Operations: 
        o	Takes user input via the input() function.
        o	Outputs results using print().
    •	Error Handling: Incorporates basic checks to manage edge cases like division by zero.
4. Example Workflow:
   1.	User starts the program and is welcomed with a prompt.
   2.	Inputs two numerical values.
   3.	Selects an operation from the menu (e.g., addition).
   4.	Program performs the operation and displays the result.
   5.	If division is selected with a divisor of zero, the program returns an error message.
This calculator program demonstrates effective use of Python's functions and conditionals, emphasizing modular design and user-friendly interaction. It ensures smooth operation through error handling and clear input-output processes.
